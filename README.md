# Regex-to-Extract-Relevant-Medical-Information

Worked with messy medical data and using regex to extract relevant infromation from the data. 

Each line of the `dates.txt` file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.

The goal was to identify all of the different date variants encoded in this dataset and to properly normalize and sort the dates.
